                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">How do we understand cats? We can actually understand cats very easily with the help of body language. We only need to follow certain signs. Because the body language of cats tells us a lot.</p>
                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;Cats, which have been seen as mysterious, lonely and unpredictable creatures for centuries, are actually just as open to communication. Cats' speech consists of a number of non-verbal messages, which can sometimes be confusing.</p>
                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;Maybe things seem a little complicated because people have trouble understanding.

                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">If you practice, you can quickly become an expert on cats' body language. So, how do we understand cats? Cats' body language has been decoded and it's now very easy to understand cats. So, if you're ready, here we go;&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up"><strong>&nbsp;Meowing, purring, hissing, growling, etc. </strong></p>
                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;</p>
                          <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;According to some scientists, this is a sign that cats consider their owners to be kittens. Because usually only communication is observed between cats through meowing between mother cats and their offspring. How true this is, it is not known! </p>

<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;<strong>Ears</strong></p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">Cats also express their emotions and intentions with their ears. For example, while forward-facing ears express interest; the more a cat's ears turn to the side and back, the greater the cat's stimulation or distress.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">Backward-facing ears are a sure sign that your cat feels threatened or doesn't like what you're doing. Especially if it's accompanied by a hiss, you might want to leave it alone!</p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up"><strong>&nbsp;Eyes&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;Cats communicate with their eyelids (according to how open or closed they are) and the expansion or contraction of the pupil (the black part of the eye). The sudden enlargement of the pupil is caused by sudden arousal, which may be due to fear, interest, or any other strong emotion.</p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">&nbsp;Wide open eyes can signal confidence, while squinting can signal fear or aggression. If your cat is staring at you with drooping, sleepy eyelids, it's a sign that your cat feels comfortable and safe. Besides that, if your cat is looking at another cat without blinking, this is a sign that she is trying to dominate or is aggressive.</p>
